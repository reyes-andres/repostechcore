            Network Cabling - (Cat, 5e, Cat 6, Cat 6a, Cat 7)
        </h1>
        <p>        
A cabling system is only as good as its design and installation. 
It is the most important investment you will make in your IT
infrastructure and will be part of your network that will last 
the longest. It is the foundation on which all other business 
activities depend. Each aspect is highly specialized and requires
trained professionals to ensure performance and reliability.  </p>   
        
<h2>With a repostech installed system you will get... </h2> 
<p>Most vendors can install network equipment and set up basic networks,
    but repostech provides the experience customers deserve. Repostech focuses not 
    only on installing a network, but securing and fine-tuning that network 
    to provide the highest level of security, stability and reliability.</p>

        <ul>
            <li> <a>SIEMON Certified Technicians - to insure quality and reliability 
                    the cable plant is installed in strict compliance to the 
                    TIA/EIA 568-B Standard.</a></li>    
            <li> <a>Every cable is run through 12 rigid tests using a Fluke DTX-1800 tester.
                    Test results are delivered to you upon the completion of every project.</a></li>  
            <li> <a>The cable plant is certified and warranted for 25 years. This includes parts, 
                    labor and applications. This is backed by the manufacturer of the components 
                    and the Fugal Company, so your investment is secure.</a></li>  
           <li> <a> Every cable, patch panel port and workstation jack is clearly 
               labeled with durable, electronically printed labels for easy identification.</a> </li>
           <li> <a> Each cable system comes with a set of Auto-Cad As-Built drawings clearly 
                   showing every workstation location with designated numbers, making it a
                   helpful management tool</a> </li>
        </ul>
<p>With a system designed and installed by repostech, complete with AutoCad As-Built Drawings and
    properly labeled cables, patch panels and face plates, the IT department completes, Moves,
    Adds and Changes in minutes instead of hours. This equals less downtime and more productivity</p>
