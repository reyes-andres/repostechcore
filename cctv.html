iVMS-4500 (Android) mobile client software, which is designed for mobile phone
on the basis of Android OS (Version 2.3.3 or higher), can be used to remotely 
monitor the live video from embedded DVR, NVR, network camera, network speed dome
and encoder via wireless network, play back record files, locally store and manage 
pictures and videos, control alarm output and realize PTZ control as well.
With this software installed in your phone, you are able to log onto the front-end
device via Wi-Fi or 3G; besides, if there is no public IP available for the device,
itâ€™s accessible by using a dynamic domain name, or by mapping ports to the public IP of router.
